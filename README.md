# Generic.ViewModels

The library **Generic.ViewModels** is based on **Prism** and adds generic view-models that are typically used showing lists of items and editing items.

> Core types like the *EventAggregator* will be removed when the samples are updated to use the Prism event service.

The library is built with these guidelines:

* .NET Standard 2.0 (oder technologies are not supported)
* You can use the existing templates from Visual Studio - using Pages, Windows without changing the base class
* In addition to *Prism*, the library uses essential libraries from Microsoft, e.g. **Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection** for a DI container
* C# 7 syntax
